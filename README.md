# Pattern Recognition

This is the course project for CMPN450 , pattern Recognition and Neural Networks.
In this project, We implement a Hand Gesture Recognition System.Given an image containing a single hand, your system is supposed to classify the hand gesture into one of six digits (from 0 to 5). we implement a complete machine
learning pipeline.
